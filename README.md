## Problem_2 - Process and analyze the public data provided by SBA.gov for each US state toextract meaningful insights from features in the dataset.            https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/Assesments/blob/main/Softsensor_problem_2.ipynb


## problem_3 
### image processing techniques 
 * **1. converting image into tensors**  https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/Assesments/blob/main/Softsensor_problem_3.ipynb
 * **2. Linear filtering**  https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/Assesments/blob/main/Softsensor_problem_3.ipynb
 * **3. 3.ICA(Independent Component Analysis)**  https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/Assesments/blob/main/Softsensor_problem_3.ipynb
 * **4. Pixelation**  https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/Assesments/blob/main/4_Pixelation.py
 * **5. Image restoration**  https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/Assesments/blob/main/5_Image%20restoration.py


### Which filter will you prefer for the detect and visualization of catheters and lines in X-ray images and why?
Most efficient preprocessiing for Deep_learning is converting image to tensor and then genrate the data.this is because finding pattern in preprocess tenosors is very effective and loading is very fast due fetch and prefetch


### How can deep learning help to detect presence of catheters and lines in images and which model you prefer?
**best performacne we got on these model:-**
 * efficientnet_v2  https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/efficientnet_v2/1
 * imagenet/mobilenet_v2_075_128/feature_vector  https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_075_128/feature_vector/5
